# for-loop
This repository is created to understand and practice the for loop in python using multiple examples. Instead of keeping only one file, each demonstrating a different use-case or approach of the for loop.

#waht is a for loop?
<br>
A *for loop* in python repeats a block of code for each item in a *sequence* (like a list, tuple, string, range, or dictionary keys).
<br>
Its the most common way to iterate (go though items one by one) in python.
<br>
<br>
**Key Idea**: "for eacg item in the collection, do something".
<br>
##basic syntax
<br>
'''python
<br>
for item in sequence:
#code to run for each item (indented with 4 spaces)
<br>
print(item)       #Example action
<br>

Requirements:
<br>
Python 3.x
<br>
Any code editor (VS Code recommended)

How To Run:
<br>
python filename.py (ex- for-loop1,..)

What I Learned:
<br>
How for loop works in Python
<br>
Using range()
<br>
Applying conditions inside loops
<br>
Creating patterns
<br>
Improving logical thinking
